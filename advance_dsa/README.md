Advance Python with OOP  and DSA

## Python DSA Topics

## Core DSA Concepts

1. **Linked List** - Understanding and implementing singly and doubly linked lists.
2. **Stacks and Queues** - Using stack and queue data structures for linear data management.
3. **Hash Tables** - Implementing efficient key-value storage and lookup.
4. **Trees** - Exploring binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and AVL trees.
5. **Graphs** - Understanding directed and undirected graphs, adjacency lists, and matrices.

### Advanced Algorithms

1. **A* Search Algorithm** - Heuristic-based pathfinding algorithm used in graph traversal.
2. **RRT*** - Rapidly-exploring Random Tree for path planning in robotics.
3. **Dynamic Programming** - Solving problems using overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
4. **Divide and Conquer** - Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts.
5. **Greedy Algorithms** - Making locally optimal choices for global optimization.
